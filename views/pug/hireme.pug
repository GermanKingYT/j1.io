              I am an extremely driven Computer Science student with a passion for practicality.
            </li>

              I am a perfectionist. If something isn't done as well as it could possibly be done, it needs to be fixed.

              Organization is key. I'm never satisfied until my work is as clean and organized as possible.

            <li>
              Writing is extremely important to me. I'm a strong writer, and I take pride in my ability to craft technical writings, as well as various other formats.

            <li>
              Resourcefulness is one of my strongest qualities. If it needs to be done, I can figure out how it should be done.
